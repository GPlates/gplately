        `pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic>`__.
        The first list represents sample points where the plates are diverging, and the second where plates are converging.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The reconstruction time (Ma) at which to query divergent/convergent plate boundaries.
        uniform_point_spacing_radians : float, default=0.001
            The spacing between uniform points along plate boundaries (in radians).
        divergence_velocity_threshold : float, default=0.0
            Orthogonal (ie, in the direction of boundary normal) velocity threshold for ``diverging`` sample points.
            Points with an orthogonal ``diverging`` velocity above this value will be returned in ``diverging_data``.
            The default is 0.0 which removes all converging sample points (leaving only diverging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of convergence is allowed for the diverging points.
            The units should match the units of ``velocity_units`` (eg, if that's cm/yr then this threshold should also be in cm/yr).
        convergence_velocity_threshold : float, default=0.0
            Orthogonal (ie, in the direction of boundary normal) velocity threshold for ``converging`` sample points.
            Points with an orthogonal ``converging`` velocity above this value will be returned in ``converging_data``.
            The default is 0.0 which removes all diverging sample points (leaving only converging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of divergence is allowed for the converging points.
            The units should match the units of ``velocity_units`` (eg, if that's cm/yr then this threshold should also be in cm/yr).
        first_uniform_point_spacing_radians : float, optional
            Spacing of first uniform point in each resolved topological section (in radians) - see
            `pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics() <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.topologicalsnapshot#pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics>`__
            for more details. Defaults to half of ``uniform_point_spacing_radians``.
        anchor_plate_id : int, optional
            Anchor plate ID. Defaults to the current anchor plate ID (:py:attr:`anchor_plate_id` attribute).
        velocity_delta_time : float, default=1.0
            The time delta used to calculate velocities (defaults to 1 Myr).
        velocity_delta_time_type : pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType, default=pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType.t_plus_delta_t_to_t
            How the two velocity times are calculated relative to ``time`` (defaults to ``[time + velocity_delta_time, time]``).
        velocity_units : pygplates.VelocityUnits, default=pygplates.VelocityUnits.cms_per_yr
            Whether to return velocities in centimetres per year or kilometres per million years (defaults to centimetres per year).
        earth_radius_in_kms : float, default=pygplates.Earth.mean_radius_in_kms
            Radius of the Earth in kilometres.
            This is only used to calculate velocities (strain rates always use ``pygplates.Earth.equatorial_radius_in_kms``).
        include_network_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to sample along network boundaries that are not also plate boundaries (defaults to False).
            If a deforming network shares a boundary with a plate then it'll get included regardless of this option.
        include_topological_slab_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to sample along slab boundaries (features of type ``gpml:TopologicalSlabBoundary``).
            By default they are not sampled since they are not plate boundaries.
        boundary_section_filter
            Same as the ``boundary_section_filter`` argument in
            `pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics() <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.topologicalsnapshot#pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics>`__.
            Defaults to None (meaning all plate boundaries are included by default).

        Returns
        -------
        diverging_data : list of pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic
            The results for all uniformly sampled points along plate boundaries that are ``diverging`` relative to ``divergence_threshold``.
            The size of the returned list is equal to the number of sampled points that are ``diverging``.
            Each `pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic>`__ is guaranteed to have a valid (ie, not None)
            `convergence velocity <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic.html#pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic.convergence_velocity>`__.
        converging_data : list of pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic
            The results for all uniformly sampled points along plate boundaries that are ``converging`` relative to ``convergence_threshold``.
            The size of the returned list is equal to the number of sampled points that are ``converging``.
            Each `pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.PlateBoundaryStatistic>`__ is guaranteed to have a valid (ie, not None)

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If topology features have not been set in this :py:class:`PlateReconstruction` object.

        Examples
        --------
        To sample diverging/converging points along plate boundaries at 50Ma:

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            diverging_data, converging_data = (
                plate_reconstruction.divergent_convergent_plate_boundaries(50)
            )

        To do the same, but restrict converging data to points where orthogonal converging velocities are greater than 0.2 cm/yr
        (with diverging data remaining unchanged with the default 0.0 threshold):

        .. code-block:: python
            :linenos:

            diverging_data, converging_data = (
                plate_reconstruction.divergent_convergent_plate_boundaries(
                    50, convergence_velocity_threshold=0.2
                )
            )

        Notes
        -----
        If you want to access all sampled points regardless of their convergence/divergence you can call :meth:`topological_snapshot()`
        and then use it to directly call `pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics() <https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/generated/pygplates.topologicalsnapshot#pygplates.TopologicalSnapshot.calculate_plate_boundary_statistics>`__.

            By default they are **not** sampled since they are *not* plate boundaries.
        boundary_section_filter
            Same as the ``boundary_section_filter`` argument in :meth:`divergent_convergent_plate_boundaries()`.

        Resolves topologies at ``time`` and tessellates all resolved subducting features into points.

        Returns a 10-column vertically-stacked tuple with the following data per sampled trench point:

        * Col. 8 - subducting plate ID
        * Col. 9 - trench plate ID

        The optional ``output_*`` parameters can be used to append extra data to the output tuple of each sampled trench point.
        The order of any extra data is the same order in which the parameters are listed below.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The reconstruction time (Ma) at which to query subduction convergence.
        tessellation_threshold_radians : float, default=0.001
            The threshold sampling distance along the plate boundaries (in radians).
        ignore_warnings : bool, default=False
            Choose to ignore warnings from :py:func:`gplately.subduction_convergence` (if ``use_ptt`` is ``True``).
        return_geodataframe : bool, default=False
            Choose to return data in a ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``.
        use_ptt : bool, default=False
            If set to ``True`` then uses :py:func:`gplately.subduction_convergence` to calculate subduction convergence
            (which uses the subducting stage rotation of the subduction/trench plate IDs calculate subducting velocities).
            If set to ``False`` then uses plate convergence to calculate subduction convergence
            (which samples velocities of the two adjacent boundary plates at each sampled point to calculate subducting velocities).
            Both methods ignore plate boundaries that do not have a subduction polarity (feature property), which essentially means
            they only sample subduction zones.
        include_network_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to calculate subduction convergence along network boundaries that are not also plate boundaries (defaults to False).
            If a deforming network shares a boundary with a plate then it'll get included regardless of this option.
            Since subduction zones occur along *plate* boundaries this would only be an issue if an intra-plate network boundary was incorrectly labelled as subducting.
        convergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr : float, optional
            Only return sample points with an orthogonal (ie, in the subducting geometry's normal direction) converging velocity above this value (in cm/yr).
            For example, setting this to ``0.0`` would remove all diverging sample points (leaving only converging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of divergence is allowed.
            If ``None`` then all (converging and diverging) sample points are returned. This is the default.
            Note that this parameter can only be specified if ``use_ptt`` is ``False``.
        anchor_plate_id : int, optional
            Anchor plate ID. Defaults to the current anchor plate ID (:py:attr:`PlateReconstruction.anchor_plate_id` attribute).
        velocity_delta_time : float, default=1.0
            Velocity delta time used in convergence velocity calculations (defaults to 1 Myr).
        output_distance_to_nearest_edge_of_trench : bool, default=False
            Append the distance (in degrees) along the trench line to the nearest trench edge to each returned sample point.
            A trench edge is the farthermost location on the current trench feature that contributes to a plate boundary.
        output_distance_to_start_edge_of_trench : bool, default=False
            Append the distance (in degrees) along the trench line from the start edge of the trench to each returned sample point.
            The start of the trench is along the clockwise direction around the overriding plate.
        output_convergence_velocity_components : bool, default=False
            Append the convergence velocity orthogonal and parallel components (in cm/yr) to each returned sample point.
            Orthogonal is normal to trench (in direction of overriding plate when positive).
            Parallel is along trench (90 degrees clockwise from trench normal when positive).
        output_trench_absolute_velocity_components : bool, default=False
            Append the trench absolute velocity orthogonal and parallel components (in cm/yr) to each returned sample point.
            Orthogonal is normal to trench (in direction of overriding plate when positive).
            Parallel is along trench (90 degrees clockwise from trench normal when positive).
        output_subducting_absolute_velocity : bool, default=False
            Append the subducting plate absolute velocity magnitude (in cm/yr) and obliquity angle (in degrees) to each returned sample point.
        output_subducting_absolute_velocity_components : bool, default=False
            Append the subducting plate absolute velocity orthogonal and parallel components (in cm/yr) to each returned sample point.
            Orthogonal is normal to trench (in direction of overriding plate when positive).
            Parallel is along trench (90 degrees clockwise from trench normal when positive).
        output_trench_normal : bool, default=False
            Append the x, y and z components of the trench normal unit-length 3D vectors.
            These vectors are normal to the trench in the direction of subduction (towards overriding plate).
            These are global 3D vectors which differ from trench normal azimuth angles (ie, angles relative to North).

        Returns
        -------
        subduction_data : a list of vertically-stacked tuples
            The results for all tessellated points sampled along the trench.
            The size of the returned list is equal to the number of tessellated points.
            Each tuple in the list corresponds to a tessellated point and has the following tuple items:

            * Col. 0 - longitude of sampled trench point
            * Col. 1 - latitude of sampled trench point
            * Col. 2 - subducting convergence (relative to trench) velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
            * Col. 3 - subducting convergence velocity obliquity angle in degrees (angle between trench normal vector and convergence velocity vector)
            * Col. 4 - trench absolute (relative to anchor plate) velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
            * Col. 5 - trench absolute velocity obliquity angle in degrees (angle between trench normal vector and trench absolute velocity vector)
            * Col. 6 - length of arc segment (in degrees) that current point is on
            * Col. 7 - trench normal (in subduction direction, ie, towards overriding plate) azimuth angle (clockwise starting at North, ie, 0 to 360 degrees) at current point
            * Col. 8 - subducting plate ID
            * Col. 9 - trench plate ID

            The optional ``output_*`` parameters can be used to append extra data to the tuple of each sampled trench point.
            The order of any extra data is the same order in which the parameters are listed in this function.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If topology features have not been set in this :py:class:`PlateReconstruction` object.
        ValueError
            If ``use_ptt`` is ``True`` and ``convergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr`` is not ``None``.

        Notes
        -----
        If ``use_ptt`` is False then each trench is sampled at **exactly** uniform intervals along its length such that the sampled points
        have a uniform spacing (along each trench polyline) that is **equal** to ``tessellation_threshold_radians``.
        If ``use_ptt`` is True then each trench is sampled at **approximately** uniform intervals along its length such that the sampled points
        have a uniform spacing (along each trench polyline) that is **less than or equal to** ``tessellation_threshold_radians``.

        The trench normal (at each sampled trench point) always points **towards** the overriding plate.
        The obliquity angles are in the range (-180, 180). The range (0, 180) goes clockwise (when viewed from above the Earth)
        from the trench normal direction to the velocity vector. The range (0, -180) goes counter-clockwise.
        You can change the range (-180, 180) to the range (0, 360) by adding 360 to negative angles.
        The trench normal is perpendicular to the trench and pointing toward the overriding plate.

        Note that the convergence velocity magnitude is negative if the plates are diverging (if convergence obliquity angle
        is greater than 90 or less than -90). And note that the trench absolute velocity magnitude is negative if the trench
        (subduction zone) is moving towards the overriding plate (if trench absolute obliquity angle is less than 90 and greater
        than -90) - note that this ignores the kinematics of the subducting plate. Similiarly for the subducting plate absolute
        velocity magnitude (if keyword argument ``output_subducting_absolute_velocity`` is True).

        The trench plate ID at each sample point can differ from the overriding plate ID.
        This is because, even in a non-deforming model, the smaller plates (not modelled by topologies) can move differently
        than the larger topological plate. So the trench line has the plate IDs of the smaller plates.

        Resolves topologies at ``time`` and tessellates all resolved subducting features into points (see :py:meth:`tessellate_subduction_zones`).

        Total length is calculated by sampling points along the resolved subducting features (e.g. subduction zones) and accumulating their lengths
        (see :py:meth:`tessellate_subduction_zones`). Scales lengths to kilometres using the geocentric radius (at each sampled point).

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : int
            The geological time at which to calculate total subduction zone lengths.
        use_ptt : bool, default=False
            If set to ``True`` then uses :py:func:`gplately.subduction_convergence` to calculate total subduction zone length.
            If set to ``False`` then uses plate convergence instead.
            Plate convergence is the more general approach that works along all plate boundaries (not just subduction zones).
        ignore_warnings : bool, default=False
            Choose to ignore warnings from :py:func:`gplately.subduction_convergence` (if ``use_ptt`` is ``True``).
        include_network_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to count lengths along network boundaries that are not also plate boundaries (defaults to False).
            If a deforming network shares a boundary with a plate then it'll get included regardless of this option.
            Since subduction zones occur along plate boundaries this would only be an issue if an intra-plate network boundary was incorrectly labelled as subducting.
        convergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr : float, optional
            Only count lengths associated with sample points that have an orthogonal (ie, in the subducting geometry's normal direction) converging velocity above this value (in cm/yr).
            For example, setting this to ``0.0`` would remove all diverging sample points (leaving only converging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of divergence is allowed.
            If ``None`` then all (converging and diverging) sample points are counted. This is the default.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The reconstruction time (Ma) at which to query spreading rates.
        tessellation_threshold_radians : float, default=0.001
            The threshold sampling distance along the plate boundaries (in radians).
        ignore_warnings : bool, default=False
            Choose to ignore warnings from Plate Tectonic Tools' :py:func:`gplately.ridge_spreading_rate` workflow (if ``use_ptt`` is True).
        return_geodataframe : bool, default=False
            Choose to return data in a ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``.
        use_ptt : bool, default=False
            If set to True then uses Plate Tectonic Tools' :py:func:`gplately.ridge_spreading_rate` workflow to calculate ridge spreading rates
            (which uses the spreading stage rotation of the left/right plate IDs calculate spreading velocities).
            If set to False then uses plate divergence to calculate ridge spreading rates
            (which samples velocities of the two adjacent boundary plates at each sampled point to calculate spreading velocities).
            Plate divergence is the more general approach that works along all plate boundaries (not just mid-ocean ridges).
        spreading_feature_types : `pygplates.FeatureType`_ or sequence of `pygplates.FeatureType`_, default=pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_mid_ocean_ridge
            Only sample points along plate boundaries of the specified feature types.
            Default is to only sample mid-ocean ridges.
            You can explicitly specify None to sample all plate boundaries, but note that if ``use_ptt`` is True
            then only plate boundaries that are spreading feature types are sampled
            (since Plate Tectonic Tools only works on spreading plate boundaries, eg, mid-ocean ridges).
        transform_segment_deviation_in_radians : float, default=<implementation-defined>
            How much a spreading direction can deviate from the segment normal before it's considered a transform segment (in radians).
            The default value has been empirically determined to give the best results for typical models.
            If ``None`` then the full feature geometry is used (ie, it is not split into ridge and transform segments with the transform segments getting ignored).
        include_network_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to calculate spreading rate along network boundaries that are not also plate boundaries (defaults to False).
            If a deforming network shares a boundary with a plate then it'll get included regardless of this option.
            Since spreading features occur along *plate* boundaries this would only be an issue if an intra-plate network boundary was incorrectly labelled as spreading.
        divergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr : float, optional
            Only return sample points with an orthogonal (ie, in the spreading geometry's normal direction) diverging velocity above this value (in cm/yr).
            For example, setting this to ``0.0`` would remove all converging sample points (leaving only diverging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of convergence is allowed.
            If ``None`` then all (diverging and converging) sample points are returned.
            This is the default since ``spreading_feature_types`` is instead used (by default) to include only plate boundaries that are typically diverging (eg, mid-ocean ridges).
            However, setting ``spreading_feature_types`` to None (and ``transform_segment_deviation_in_radians`` to None) and explicitly specifying this parameter (eg, to 0.0)
            can be used to find points along all plate boundaries that are diverging.
            However, this parameter can only be specified if ``use_ptt`` is False.
        output_obliquity_and_normal_and_left_right_plates : bool, default=False
            Whether to also return spreading obliquity, normal azimuth and left/right plates.
        anchor_plate_id : int, optional
            Anchor plate ID. Defaults to the current anchor plate ID (:py:attr:`anchor_plate_id` attribute)..
        velocity_delta_time : float, default=1.0
            Velocity delta time used in spreading velocity calculations (defaults to 1 Myr).

        Returns
        -------
        ridge_data : a list of vertically-stacked tuples
            The results for all tessellated points sampled along the mid-ocean ridges.
            The size of the returned list is equal to the number of tessellated points.
            Each tuple in the list corresponds to a tessellated point and has the following tuple items
            (depending on ``output_obliquity_and_normal_and_left_right_plates``):

            If ``output_obliquity_and_normal_and_left_right_plates`` is False (the default):

            * longitude of sampled point
            * latitude of sampled point
            * spreading velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
            * length of arc segment (in degrees) that sampled point is on

            If ``output_obliquity_and_normal_and_left_right_plates`` is True:

            * longitude of sampled point
            * latitude of sampled point
            * spreading velocity magnitude (in cm/yr)
            * spreading obliquity in degrees (deviation from normal line in range 0 to 90 degrees)
            * length of arc segment (in degrees) that sampled point is on
            * azimuth of vector normal to the arc segment in degrees (clockwise starting at North, ie, 0 to 360 degrees)
            * left plate ID
            * right plate ID

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If topology features have not been set in this :py:class:`PlateReconstruction` object.
        ValueError
            If ``use_ptt`` is True and ``divergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr`` is not None.

        Notes
        -----
        If ``use_ptt`` is False then each ridge segment is sampled at exactly uniform intervals along its length such that the sampled points
        have a uniform spacing (along each ridge segment polyline) that is equal to ``tessellation_threshold_radians``.
        If ``use_ptt`` is True then each ridge segment is sampled at approximately uniform intervals along its length such that the sampled points
        have a uniform spacing (along each ridge segment polyline) that is less than or equal to ``tessellation_threshold_radians``.

        The transform segments of spreading features are ignored (unless ``transform_segment_deviation_in_radians`` is ``None``).

        Total length is calculated by sampling points along the resolved spreading features (e.g. mid-ocean ridges) and accumulating their lengths
        (see :py:meth:`tessellate_mid_ocean_ridges`). Scales lengths to kilometres using the geocentric radius (at each sampled point).

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : int
            The geological time at which to calculate total mid-ocean ridge lengths.
        use_ptt : bool, default=False
            If set to ``True`` then uses :py:func:`gplately.ridge_spreading_rate()` to calculate total ridge length
            (which uses the spreading stage rotation of the left/right plate IDs to calculate spreading directions - see ``transform_segment_deviation_in_radians``).
            If set to ``False`` then uses plate divergence to calculate total ridge length (which samples velocities of the two adjacent
            boundary plates at each sampled point to calculate spreading directions - see ``transform_segment_deviation_in_radians``).
            Plate divergence is the more general approach that works along all plate boundaries (not just mid-ocean ridges).
        ignore_warnings : bool, default=False
            Choose to ignore warnings from :py:func:`gplately.ridge_spreading_rate()` (if ``use_ptt`` is ``True``).
        spreading_feature_types : `pygplates.FeatureType`_ or sequence of `pygplates.FeatureType`_, default=pygplates.FeatureType.gpml_mid_ocean_ridge
            Only count lengths along plate boundaries of the specified feature types.
            Default is to only sample mid-ocean ridges.
            You can explicitly specify ``None`` to sample all plate boundaries, but note that if ``use_ptt`` is ``True``
            then only plate boundaries that are spreading feature types are sampled
            (since Plate Tectonic Tools only works on **spreading** plate boundaries, eg, mid-ocean ridges).
        transform_segment_deviation_in_radians : float, default=<implementation-defined>
            How much a spreading direction can deviate from the segment normal before it's considered a transform segment (in radians).
            The default value has been empirically determined to give the best results for typical models.
            If ``None`` then the full feature geometry is used (ie, it is not split into ridge and transform segments with the transform segments getting ignored).
        include_network_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to count lengths along network boundaries that are not also plate boundaries (defaults to False).
            If a deforming network shares a boundary with a plate then it'll get included regardless of this option.
            Since spreading features occur along plate boundaries this would only be an issue if an intra-plate network boundary was incorrectly labelled as spreading.
        divergence_threshold_in_cm_per_yr : float, optional
            Only count lengths associated with sample points that have an orthogonal (ie, in the spreading geometry's normal direction) diverging velocity above this value (in cm/yr).
            For example, setting this to ``0.0`` would remove all converging sample points (leaving only diverging points).
            This value can be negative which means a small amount of convergence is allowed.
            If ``None`` then all (diverging and converging) sample points are counted.
            This is the default since ``spreading_feature_types`` is instead used (by default) to include only plate boundaries that are typically diverging (eg, mid-ocean ridges).
            However, setting ``spreading_feature_types`` to ``None`` (and ``transform_segment_deviation_in_radians`` to ``None``) and explicitly specifying this parameter (eg, to ``0.0``)
            can be used to count points along all plate boundaries that are diverging.
            However, this parameter can only be specified if ``use_ptt`` is ``False``.

            A 1D array of point data's latitudes.

        time : float
            The specific geological time (Ma) at which to calculate plate velocities.

        delta_time : float, default=1.0
            The time interval used for velocity calculations. 1.0Ma by default.

        velocity_delta_time_type : pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType, default=pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType.t_plus_delta_t_to_t
            How the two velocity times are calculated relative to ``time`` (defaults to ``[time + velocity_delta_time, time]``).

        velocity_units : pygplates.VelocityUnits, default=pygplates.VelocityUnits.kms_per_my

        earth_radius_in_kms : float, default=pygplates.Earth.mean_radius_in_kms
            Radius of the Earth in kilometres.
            This is only used to calculate velocities (strain rates always use ``pygplates.Earth.equatorial_radius_in_kms``).

        include_networks : bool, default=True
            Whether to include deforming networks when calculating velocities.
            By default they are included (and also given precedence since they typically overlay a rigid plate).

        include_topological_slab_boundaries : bool, default=False
            Whether to include features of type ``gpml:TopologicalSlabBoundary`` when calculating velocities.
            By default they are not included (they tend to overlay a rigid plate which should instead be used to calculate plate velocity).

        anchor_plate_id : int, optional

        return_east_north_arrays : bool, default=False
            Return the velocities as arrays separately containing the east and north components of the velocities.
            Note that setting this to True matches the output of :py:meth:`Points.plate_velocity`.

        Returns
        -------
        north_east_velocities : 2D ndarray
            Only provided if ``return_east_north_arrays`` is False.
            Each array element contains the (north, east) velocity components of a single point.
        east_velocities, north_velocities : 1D ndarray
            Only provided if ``return_east_north_arrays`` is True.
            The east and north components of velocities as separate arrays.
            These are also ordered (east, north) instead of (north, east).

        ------
        ValueError

            The velocities are in ``kilometres per million years`` by default (not ``centimetres per year``,
            the default in :py:meth:`Points.plate_velocity`).
            This difference is maintained for backward compatibility.

            For each velocity, the ``north`` component is first followed by the ``east`` component.
            This is different to :py:meth:`Points.plate_velocity` where the ``east`` component is first.
