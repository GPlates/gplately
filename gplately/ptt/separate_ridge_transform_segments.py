    # group have the same time-of-appearance. They need to have the same time of appearance because, in pyGPlates,
    # version 3 half-stage rotations start spreading from the time-of-appearance in 10 My intervals

    # And because the mid-ocean ridges with the same time-of-appearance also have the same time intervals
    # they'll reuse the cached reconstruction trees (one cached tree per time interval).
    # This will avoid a lot of wasted time recreating these trees if the cache is continually flushed
    # (eg, by mixing mid-ocean ridges with different appearance times).
