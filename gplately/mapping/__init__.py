# This submodule contains code to plot maps.
# The folder is named "mapping" to avoid name conflicts with the "plot" submodule.
# The folder name is inspired by GMT(The Generic Mapping Tools).
# The PlotEngine abstract base class is defined in plot_engine.py.
# There are different PlotEngine subclasses, CartopyPlotEngine and PygmtPlotEngine, for different plotting libraries,
# such as Cartopy and PyGMT.
