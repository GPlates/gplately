    """Generate subduction teeth triangles for plotting.

    Forms continuous trench geometries and identifies their subduction polarities.
    Subduction teeth triangles can be customised with a given spacing and width.
    Their apexes point in the identified polarity directions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometries : geopandas.GeoDataFrame, sequence of shapely geometries, or str
        If a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` is given, its geometry attribute
        will be used. If `geometries` is a string, it must be the path to
        a file, which will be loaded with `geopandas.read_file`. Otherwise,
        `geometries` must be a sequence of shapely geometry objects (instances
        of the `shapely.geometry.base.BaseGeometry` class).
    width : float
        The (approximate) width of the subduction teeth. If a projection is
        used, this value will be in projected units.
    polarity : {"left", "l", "right", "r", None}, default "left"
        The subduction polarity of the geometries. If no polarity is provided,
        and `geometries` is a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, this function will
        attempt to find a `polarity` column in the data frame and use the
        values given there. If `polarity` is not manually specified and no
        appropriate column can be found, an error will be raised.
    height : float, default None
        If provided, the height of the subduction teeth. As with `width`,
        this value should be given in projected units. If no value is given,
        the height of the teeth will be equal to 0.6 * `width`.
    spacing : float, default None
        If provided, the spacing between the subduction teeth. As with
        `width` and `height`, this value should be given in projected units.
        If no value is given, `spacing` will default to `width`, producing
        tightly packed subduction teeth.
    projection : cartopy.crs.Transform, "auto", or None, default None
        The projection of the plot. If the plot has no projection, this value
        can be explicitly given as `None`. The default value is "auto", which
        will acquire the projection automatically from the plot axes.
    transform : cartopy.crs.Transform, or None, default None
        If the plot is projected, a `transform` value is usually needed.
        Frequently, the appropriate value is an instance of
        `cartopy.crs.PlateCarree`.

    Returns
    -------
    results : list of shapely Polygon objects
        Subduction teeth generated for the given geometries.
