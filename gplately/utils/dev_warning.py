            Some functionalities in the DEV version have not been tested thoroughly,

            its unstable nature(DEV in progress). Proceed With Caution!!!
            You might also need to install the DEV version plate_model_manager 
            from https://github.com/michaelchin/plate-model-manager.

            To disable this warning, set USING_DEV_VERSION to False in __init__.py or
            set DISABLE_GPLATELY_DEV_WARNING environment variable to true.
