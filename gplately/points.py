        plate_reconstruction : PlateReconstruction
            Object to provide the following essential components for reconstructing points.

            * :py:attr:`PlateReconstruction.topology_featues`
            * :py:attr:`PlateReconstruction.static_polygons`

        lons : float or 1D array
            Longitudes of the initial points at the initial ``time``.

        lats : float or 1D array
            Latitudes of the initial points at the initial ``time``.

        time : float, default=0
            The initial time (Ma) of the points.
            The ``lons`` and ``lats`` are the initial coordinates of the points at this time.
            By default, it is set to the present day (0 Ma).

        plate_id : int or 1D array or None, default=None
            Plate ID(s) of a particular tectonic plate on which point data lies, if known.
            If it is a single integer then all points will have the same plate ID. If it is a 1D array then length must match the number of points.
            If ``None`` then plate IDs are determined using the :py:attr:`PlateReconstruction.static_polygons`.
            By default, the plate IDs are determined using the static polygons.

        age : float or 1D array or None, default=numpy.inf
            Age(s) at which each point appears, if known.
            If it is a single float then all points will have the same age.
            If it is a 1D array then length must match the number of points.
            If ``None`` then ages are determined using the :py:attr:`PlateReconstruction.static_polygons`.
            For points on oceanic crust this is when they were created at a mid-ocean ridge.
            By default, all points exist for all time (ie, time of appearance is infinity). This default is for backward
            compatibility, but you'll typically only want this if all your points are on **continental** crust (not *oceanic*).

        anchor_plate_id : int, optional
            Anchor plate ID that the specified ``lons`` and ``lats`` are relative to.
            Defaults to the current anchor plate ID of ``plate_reconstruction`` (its ``anchor_plate_id`` attribute).

        remove_unreconstructable_points : bool or list, default=False
            Whether to remove points that cannot be reconstructed.
            By default, all unreconstructable points are retained.
            A point cannot be reconstructed if it cannot be assigned a plate ID, or cannot be assigned an age, because it did not
            intersect any reconstructed static polygons (note that this can only happen when ``plate_id`` and/or ``age`` is None).
            Also, a point cannot be reconstructed if point ages were **explicitly** provided (ie, ``age`` was **not** None) and
            a point's age was less than (younger than) ``time``, meaning it did not exist as far back as ``time``.
            Additionally, if this variable is a :py:class:`list` then the indices (into the supplied ``lons`` and ``lats`` arguments)
            of any removed points (ie, that are unreconstructable) are appended to that list.


        .. _points-note:
        .. note::

            If ``time`` is non-zero (ie, not present day) then ``lons`` and ``lats`` are assumed to be the **reconstructed** point
            locations at ``time``. And the reconstructed positions are assumed to be relative to the anchor plate
            (which is ``plate_reconstruction.anchor_plate_id`` if ``anchor_plate_id`` is None).

            If ``plate_id`` and/or ``age`` is None then the plate ID and/or age of each point is determined by reconstructing the static polygons
            of ``plate_reconstruction`` to ``time`` and reconstructing relative to the anchor plate (regardless of whether ``time`` is present day or not).
            And then, for each point, assigning the plate ID and/or time-of-appearance (begin time) of the static polygon containing the point.

            A point is considered unreconstructable if it does not exist at ``time``. This can happen if its age was explicitly provided (ie, ``age`` is **not** None)
            but is younger than ``time``. It can also happen if the point is automatically assigned a plate ID (ie, ``plate_id`` is None) or an age (ie, ``age`` is None)
            but does not intersect any reconstructed static polygons (at ``time``). In either of these cases it is marked as unreconstructable and will not be available
            for any method outputing a reconstruction, such as :meth:`reconstruct()`, or any method depending on a reconstruction, such as :meth:`plate_velocity`.
            However, all the initial locations and their associated plate IDs and ages will still be accessible as attributes, regardless of whether all the points
            are reconstructable or not. That is, unless ``remove_unreconstructable_points`` is True (or a :py:class:`list`),
            in which case only the reconstructable points are retained.

        The point velocities are calculated using the plate IDs of the internal points and the rotation model of the internal :class:`PlateReconstruction` object.
        If the requested ``time`` differs from the initial time (``self.time``) then the internal points are first reconstructed to ``time`` before calculating velocities.
        Velocities are only calculated at points that are reconstructable (See :ref:`Notes <points-note>`) and that have ages greater than or equal to
        ``time`` (ie, at points that exist at ``time``).

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The specific geological time (Ma) at which to calculate plate velocities.

        delta_time : float, default=1.0
            The time interval used for velocity calculations. 1.0Ma by default.

        velocity_delta_time_type : pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType, default=pygplates.VelocityDeltaTimeType.t_plus_delta_t_to_t
            How the two velocity times are calculated relative to ``time`` (defaults to ``[time + velocity_delta_time, time]``).

        velocity_units : pygplates.VelocityUnits, default=pygplates.VelocityUnits.cms_per_yr
            Whether to return velocities in centimetres per year or kilometres per million years (defaults to centimetres per year).

        earth_radius_in_kms : float, default=pygplates.Earth.mean_radius_in_kms
            Radius of the Earth in kilometres.
            This is only used to calculate velocities (strain rates always use ``pygplates.Earth.equatorial_radius_in_kms``).

        anchor_plate_id : int, optional
            Anchor plate used to reconstruct the points and calculate velocities at their locations.
            By default, reconstructions are made with respect to ``self.anchor_plate_id``
            (which is the anchor plate that the initial points at the initial time are relative to).

        return_reconstructed_points : bool, default=False
            Return the reconstructed points (as longitude and latitude arrays) in addition to the velocities.

        return_point_indices : bool, default=False
            Return the indices of those internal points at which velocities are calculated.
            These are indices into ``self.lons``, ``self.lats``, ``self.plate_id`` and ``self.age``.
            Those points with an age less than ``time`` have not yet appeared at ``time``, and therefore will not have velocities returned.

        Returns
        -------
        velocity_lons, velocity_lats : ndarray
            The velocity arrays containing the **east** (longitude) and *north* (latitude) components of the velocity
            of each internal point that exists at ``time`` (ie, whose age greater than or equal to ``time``).
        rlons, rlats : ndarray
            Only provided if ``return_reconstructed_points`` is True.
            The longitude and latitude coordinate arrays of the reconstructed points (at which velocities are calculated).
            These arrays are the same size as ``velocity_lons`` and ``velocity_lats``.
        point_indices : ndarray
            Only provided if ``return_point_indices`` is True.
            The indices of the returned points (at which velocities are calculated).
            These are indices into ``self.lons``, ``self.lats``, ``self.plate_id`` and ``self.age``.
            This array is the same size as ``velocity_lons`` and ``velocity_lats``.


        .. note::

            The velocities are in **centimetres per year** by default (not **kilometres per million years**, the default
            in :meth:`PlateReconstruction.get_point_velocities`).
            This difference is maintained for backward compatibility.

            For each velocity, the *east** component is first followed by the *north* component.
            This is different to :meth:`PlateReconstruction.get_point_velocities` where the **north** component is first.
            This difference is maintained for backward compatibility.


        .. seealso::
