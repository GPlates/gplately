        Parameters
        ----------

        feature_type : instance of `pygplates.FeatureType`
            The type of feature. See

    This is traditionally so that a group of  features can be loaded, saved or

    Examples
    --------

    For example, to read coastline features from a file:

        coastline_feature_collection = pygplates.FeatureCollection('coastlines.gpml')

    And to write coastline features to a file:

        coastline_feature_collection = pygplates.FeatureCollection(coastline_features)
        coastline_feature_collection.write('coastlines.gpml')

    To create a new feature collection from a sequence of `features`:

        # ...is the equivalent of...

        feature_collection = pygplates.FeatureCollection()

    In the future, support will be added to enable users to implement and register readers/writers for other file formats (or their own non-standard file formats).


    Operations for accessing features
    ---------------------------------

    The following operations for accessing the features are supported:


    * `len(fc)` : Number of features in feature collection `fc`.

    * `for f in fc` : Iterates over the features `f` in feature collection `fc`.

    * `fc[i]` : The feature of fc at index `i`.


    For example:

        num_features = len(feature_collection)
        features_in_collection = [feature for feature in feature_collection]
        # assert(num_features == len(features_in_collection))
