- `01 - Getting Started`_: A brief overview of how to initialise GPlately's main objects
- `02 - Plate Reconstructions`_: Setting up a **PlateReconstruction** object, reconstructing geological data through time
- `03 - Working with Points`_: Setting up a **Points** object, reconstructing seed point locations through time with. This notebook uses point data from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB).
- `04 - Velocity Basics`_: Calculating plate velocities, plotting velocity vector fields
- `05 - Working with Feature Geometries`_: Processing and plotting assorted polyline, polygon and point data from `GPlates 2.3's sample data sets`_.
- `06 - Rasters`_: Reading, resizing, resampling raster data, and linearly interpolating point data onto raster data
- `07 - Plate Tectonic Stats`_: Calculating and plotting subduction zone and ridge data (convergence/spreading velocities, subduction angles, subduction zone and ridge lengths, crustal surface areas produced and subducted etc.)
- `08 - Predicting Slab Flux`_: Predicting the average slab dip angle of subducting oceanic lithosphere.
- `09 - Motion Paths and Flowlines`_: Using pyGPlates to create motion paths and flowines of points on a tectonic plate to illustrate the plate's trajectory through geological time.
- `10 - SeafloorGrid`_: Defines the parameters needed to set up a **SeafloorGrid** object, and demonstrates how to produce age and spreading rate grids from a set of plate reconstruction model files.
- `11 - AndesFluxes`_: Demonstrates how the reconstructed subduction history along the Andean margin can be potentially used in the plate kinematics analysis and data mining.
