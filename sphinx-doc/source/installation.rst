conda (recommended)
-------------------

The latest stable public release of **GPlately** can be installed using conda_ from the `conda-forge channel`_. 
The following commands will create a new conda environment called **my-gplately-conda-env** and install GPlately within that environment.

.. code:: console

    $ conda create -n my-gplately-conda-env
    $ conda activate my-gplately-conda-env
    $ conda install -c conda-forge gplately

.. note::
    
    ‚úèÔ∏è If conda gets **stuck while solving the environment** during the installation of GPlately, you can try to use micromamba_ instead.
