# ========================================= <gplately.PlotTopologies> =========================================

""" 
A series of automated tests that ensure GPlately's <DataServer> object collects the necessary
continent, coastline and continent-ocean boundary shapefiles/GPML files to initialise the 
<PlotTopologies> object with the MÃ¼ller et al. (2019) plate reconstruction model. The following 
methods in the object are tested:

    - __init__ 
        This includes testing update_time; this ensures all geometries in the provided coastline,
        COB and/or continent files can be reconstructed to 0 and 100 Ma. It also ensures that the 
        outputs of Plate Tectonic Tools' resolve_topologies method:

            - resolved topology features (topological plates and networks)
            - ridge and transform boundary sections (resolved features)
            - ridge boundary sections (resolved features)
            - transform boundary sections (resolved features)
            - subduction boundary sections (resolved features)
            - left subduction boundary sections (resolved features)
            - right subduction boundary sections (resolved features)
            - other boundary sections (resolved features) that are not subduction zones or mid-ocean ridges (ridge/transform)

        are initialised in the <PlotTopologies> object for a given plate reconstruction model.

    - Plotting functions: (not implemented yet)
        This ensures that <cartopy.mpl.GeoAxis> objects are created with the attributes passed to
        <PlotTopologies>. Namely, the following plotting methods are tested:

            - plot_coastlines
            - plot_continents
            - plot_continent_ocean_boundaries
            - plot_ridges
            - plot_ridges_and_transforms
            - plot_transforms
            - plot_trenches
            - plot_misc_boundaries
            - plot_plate_id
            - plot_subduction_teeth
            - plot_grid
            - plot_grid_from_netCDF
            - plot_plate_motion_vectors
