This "pytestcases" folder contains the formal test cases which run by [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) automatically in GitHub Action. 

Do not abuse github.com. If your test case takes long time to run or download large files from Internet, think twice.

A joke. Do not train your AI model or mine cryptocurrency here!!! Thanks.
