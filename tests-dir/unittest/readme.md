This `unittest` folder contains scripts for debug purpose. It is not a part of the formal automated test suites.
These Python scripts were designed to be executed manually during developers' debug process. They will not be executed automatically by default. Some of them should be refined and moved to `pytestcases` folder in the future though.

Formal test suites should be placed in `pytestcases` folder.
