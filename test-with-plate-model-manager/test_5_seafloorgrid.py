# ========================================= <gplately.SeafloorGrid> =========================================

""" 
A series of automated tests that ensure GPlately's <SeafloorGrid> object can be initialised and all gridding
routines can be performed. The routines must also return sensible grids - for example, spreading rate grids 
must not have an excessive amount of NaN entries (which may mean incorrect masking has occurred).
The following methods in the object are tested:

    - __init__ 
    - reconstruct_by_topologies
    - lon_lat_z_to_netcdf

These tests will be conducted using the Muller et al. 2019 model, with the gridding time range of 250-249 Ma (one
time step).
