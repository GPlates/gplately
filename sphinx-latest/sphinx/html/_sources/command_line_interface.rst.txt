Command Line Interface (CLI)
============================

GPlately comes with a collection of useful command-line tools, each designed as a subcommand of GPlately. 

.. note::

   - Run ``gplately -h`` to see a list of available subcommands.
   - Run ``gplately one-of-the-subcommands -h`` to see the usage of the given subcommand. For example, ``gplately list -h``.

  If you are using Docker, prefix ``docker run gplates/gplately`` to the command, such as ``docker run gplates/gplately gplately reset_feature_type -s ".*" -t gpml:UnclassifiedFeature input_file output_file``.

.. seealso::

  Check out `this shell script <https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/tests-dir/unittest/test_reset_feature_type.sh>`__ for more "gplately reset_feature_type" examples. 

agegrid (ag)
------------

Generate age grids for a plate reconstruction model. 

👉 create age grids from 10 Ma to 0 Ma with 1 Myr increment for the `merdith2021` reconstruction model

.. code:: console

   $ gplately ag output -m merdith2021 -e 0 -s 10
   
👉 create age grids from 10 Ma to 0 Ma with 1 Myr increment using the specified reconstruction files

gpmdb
-----

Retrieve the paleomagnetic data from the `GPMDB website <http://www.gpmdb.net>`__, create GPlates-compatible VGP features and save them in a .gpmlz file. 

👉 download the paleomagnetic data and generate GPlates-compatible VGP features using the `zahirovic2022` reconstruction model

.. code:: console

   $ gplately gpmdb -m zahirovic2022 -o vgp.gpmlz
