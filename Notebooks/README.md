## Sample workflows

To see GPlately in action, launch a Jupyter Notebook environment and check out the sample notebooks listed below.

- [**01 - Getting Started**](01-GettingStarted.ipynb): A brief overview of how to initialise GPlately's main objects
- [**02 - Plate Reconstructions**](02-PlateReconstructions.ipynb): Setting up a `PlateReconstruction` object, reconstructing geological data through time
- [**03 - Working with Points**](03-WorkingWithPoints.ipynb): Setting up a `Points` object, reconstructing seed point locations through time with. This notebook uses point data from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB).
- [**04 - Velocity Basics**](04-VelocityBasics.ipynb): Calculating plate velocities, plotting velocity vector fields
- [**05 - Working with Feature Geometries**](05-WorkingWithFeatureGeometries.ipynb): Processing and plotting assorted polyline, polygon and point data from [GPlates 2.3's sample data sets](https://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-3-software-and-data-sets/)
- [**06 - Rasters**](06-Rasters.ipynb): Reading, resizing, resampling raster data, and linearly interpolating point data onto raster data
- [**07 - Plate Tectonic Stats**](07-WorkingWithPlateTectonicStats.ipynb): Using `PlateTectonicTools` to calculate and plot subduction zone and ridge data (convergence/spreading velocities, subduction angles, subduction zone and ridge lengths, crustal surface areas produced and subducted etc.)
- [**08 - Predicting Slab Flux**](08-PredictingSlabFlux.ipynb): Predicting the average slab dip angle of subducting oceanic lithosphere.
- [**09 - Motion Paths and Flowlines**](09-CreatingMotionPathsAndFlowlines.ipynb): Using pyGPlates to create motion paths and flowlines of points on a tectonic plate to illustrate the plate's trajectory through geological time.
- [**10 - SeafloorGrid**](10-SeafloorGrids.ipynb): Defines the parameters needed to set up a `SeafloorGrid` object, and demonstrates how to produce age and spreading rate grids from a set of plate reconstruction model files.
- [**11 - AndesFluxes**](11-AndesFluxes.ipynb): Demonstrates how the reconstructed subduction history along the Andean margin can be potentially used in the plate kinematics analysis and data mining.
