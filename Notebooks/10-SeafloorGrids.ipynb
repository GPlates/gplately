    "Running `seafloorgrid.reconstruct_by_topologies()` prepares all ocean basin points and their z-values for gridding, and reconstructs all active points per timestep to form the grids per timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial conditions\n",
    "At `max_time`, an initial ocean seed point icosahedral mesh fills the ocean basin. Each point is allocated a z-value, and this is stored in an .npz data frame at `max_time`. A netCDF4 continent mask is also produced at `max_time`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the initial condition: the ocean basin is populated with an `intial_mean_ocean_spreading_rate` of 50 mm/yr at a `max_time` of 410Ma. Reconstruction over 10Myr to 400Ma sees the points emerging from ridges with their own plate-model-ascribed spreading rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "![init_condition](./NotebookFiles/Notebook9/Merdith2021_initial_sr_conditions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing for gridding\n",
    "At each successive timestep (`ridge_time_step`), new points emerge from spreading ridges, and they are allocated their own z-values. The workflow recursively outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 netCDF4 continent mask\n",
    "* 1 GPMLZ file with point features emerging at spreading ridges (resolved according to the specified `ridge_sampling`)\n",
    "* 1 .npz data frame for point feature z-values\n",
    "\n",
    "for each time up to `min_time`. *If the `resume_from_checkpoints` parameter is passed as `True`, and this preparation stage in `seafloorgrid.reconstruct_by_topologies()` is interrupted between `max_time` to `min_time`, you can rerun the cell. The workflow will pick up from where it left off provided all files that have been saved before interruption have not been erased.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To overwrite all files in `save_directory` (restart the preparation at `max_time`), pass `resume_from_checkpoints` as `False`. This happens by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reconstruct by topologies\n",
    "Once gridding preparation is complete, the `ReconstructByTopologies` object (written by Simon Williams, Nicky Wright, and John Cannon) in GPlately's `reconstruct` is automatically run. `ReconstructByTopologies` (RBT) identifies active points on the ocean basin per timestep. It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ocean point on one plate ID transitions into another rigid plate ID at the next timestep, RBT calculates the point's velocity difference between both plates. The point **may** have subducted/collided with a continent at this boundary if this velocity difference is higher than a set velocity threshold. To ascertain whether the point should indeed be deactivated, a second test is conducted: RBT checks the previous time position of the point and calculates this pointâs proximity to the boundary of the plate ID polygon it is approaching. If this distance is higher than a set distance threshold, then the point is far enough away from the boundary that it cannot be subducted or consumed by it and hence the point is still active. Else, it is deactivated/deleted.\n",
