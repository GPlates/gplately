</ul>
<p>First, the global domain of initial points is created using
<a href="https://github.com/underworldcode/stripy/blob/master/stripy/spherical_meshes.py#L27">stripy's</a>
icosahedral triangulated mesh. The number of points in this mesh can be

the more resolved the continent masks will be). </p>
<p><img alt="RefinementLevels" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/pdoc_Files/seafloorgrid_refinement.png"></p>
<p>These points are spatially partitioned by plate ID so they can be passed
into a
<a href="https://gplates.github.io/gplately/oceans.html#gplately.oceans.point_in_polygon_routine">point-in-polygon routine</a>.
This identifies points that lie within
continental polygon boundaries and those that are in the ocean. From this,
<a href="https://gplates.github.io/gplately/oceans.html#gplately.oceans.SeafloorGrid.build_all_continental_masks">continental masks are built</a>
per timestep, and the initial seed points are
allocated ages at the first reconstruction timestep <code>max_time</code>. Each point's
initial age is calculated by dividing its proximity to the nearest
MOR segment by half its assumed spreading rate. This spreading rate
(<code>initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate</code>) is assumed to be uniform for all points.</p>
<p>These initial points momentarily fill the global ocean basin, and all have uniform spreading rates.
Thus, the spreading rate grid at <code>max_time</code> will be uniformly populated with the <code>initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate</code> (mm/yr).
The age grid at <code>max_time</code> will look like a series of smooth, linear age gradients clearly partitioned by
tectonic plates with unique plate IDs:</p>

at a specified ridge sampling spacing (<code>ridge_sampling</code>). Each point is

model files, as opposed to ages of the initial ocean mesh points), a point index
and the general z-value that will be gridded onto it. </p>

if this velocity difference is higher than a specified velocity threshold (which can be
controlled with <code>subduction_collision_parameters</code>). To ascertain whether the point
should be deactivated, a displacement test is conducted. If the proximity of the
point's previous time position to the polygon boundary it is approaching is higher than
a set distance threshold, then the point is far enough away from the boundary that it
cannot be subducted or consumed by it, and hence the point is still active. Otherwise,

<p>With each reconstruction time step, points from mid-ocean ridges (which have more

icosahedral mesh) should be deleted over time. However, not all will be deleted -
such points typically reside near continental boundaries. This happens if the
emerged ridge points do not spread far enough to "phase out" these points at
collision regions - likely due to insufficient reconstruction detail. These
undeleted points form artefacts of anomalously high seafloor age that append
over the reconstruction time range. </p>

and other oceanic data from the `gplately.PlateReconstruction` and 
`gplately.PlotToplogies` objects. 

Gridding methods in this module have been adapted from Simon Williams&#39; 
development repository for an 
[auto-age-gridding workflow](https://github.com/siwill22/agegrid-0.1), and are kept 
within the `SeafloorGrid` object.

The sample jupyter notebook 
[10-SeafloorGrid](https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/10-SeafloorGrids.ipynb) 
demonstrates how the functionalities within `SeafloorGrid` work. Below you can find
documentation for each of `SeafloorGrid`&#39;s functions.

`SeafloorGrid` Methodology
--------------------------
There are two main steps that `SeafloorGrid` follows to generate grids:

1. Preparation for reconstruction by topologies
2. Reconstruction by topologies

The preparation step involves building a:

* global domain of initial points that populate the seafloor at `max_time`, 
* continental mask that separates ocean points from continent regions per timestep, and
* set of points that emerge to the left and right of mid-ocean 
ridge segments per timestep, as well as the z-value to allocate to these
points.

First, the global domain of initial points is created using 
[stripy&#39;s](https://github.com/underworldcode/stripy/blob/master/stripy/spherical_meshes.py#L27)
icosahedral triangulated mesh. The number of points in this mesh can be
controlled using a `refinement_levels` integer (the larger this integer,
the more resolved the continent masks will be). 

![RefinementLevels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/pdoc_Files/seafloorgrid_refinement.png)

These points are spatially partitioned by plate ID so they can be passed
into a 
[point-in-polygon routine](https://gplates.github.io/gplately/oceans.html#gplately.oceans.point_in_polygon_routine). 
This identifies points that lie within
continental polygon boundaries and those that are in the ocean. From this,
[continental masks are built](https://gplates.github.io/gplately/oceans.html#gplately.oceans.SeafloorGrid.build_all_continental_masks) 
per timestep, and the initial seed points are
allocated ages at the first reconstruction timestep `max_time`. Each point&#39;s 
initial age is calculated by dividing its proximity to the nearest
MOR segment by half its assumed spreading rate. This spreading rate 
(`initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate`) is assumed to be uniform for all points.

These initial points momentarily fill the global ocean basin, and all have uniform spreading rates.
Thus, the spreading rate grid at `max_time` will be uniformly populated with the `initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate` (mm/yr).
The age grid at `max_time` will look like a series of smooth, linear age gradients clearly partitioned by 
tectonic plates with unique plate IDs:

![MaxTimeGrids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/pdoc_Files/max_time_grids.png)

[Ridge &#34;line&#34; topologies](https://gplates.github.io/gplately/oceans.html#gplately.oceans.SeafloorGrid.build_all_MOR_seedpoints) 
are resolved at each reconstruction time step and partitioned
into segments with a valid stage rotation. Each segment is further divided into points 
at a specified ridge sampling spacing (`ridge_sampling`). Each point is 
ascribed a latitude, longitude, spreading rate and age (from plate reconstruction 
model files, as opposed to ages of the initial ocean mesh points), a point index 
and the general z-value that will be gridded onto it. 

![NewRidgePoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/pdoc_Files/new_ridge_points.png)

Reconstruction by topologies involves determining which points are active and 
inactive (collided with a continent or subducted at a trench) for each reconstruction 
time step. This is done using a hidden object in `PlateReconstruction` called 
`ReconstructByTopologies`.

If an ocean point with a certain velocity on one plate ID transitions into another 
rigid plate ID at another timestep (with another velocity), the velocity difference 
between both plates is calculated. The point may have subducted/collided with a continent 
if this velocity difference is higher than a specified velocity threshold (which can be
controlled with `subduction_collision_parameters`). To ascertain whether the point 
should be deactivated, a displacement test is conducted. If the proximity of the 
point&#39;s previous time position to the polygon boundary it is approaching is higher than 
a set distance threshold, then the point is far enough away from the boundary that it 
cannot be subducted or consumed by it, and hence the point is still active. Otherwise, 
it is deemed inactive and deleted from the ocean basin mesh. 

With each reconstruction time step, points from mid-ocean ridges (which have more 
accurate spreading rates and attributed valid times) will spread across the ocean
floor. Eventually, points will be pushed into continental boundaries or subduction 
zones, where they are deleted. Ideally, all initial ocean points (from the Stripy 
icosahedral mesh) should be deleted over time. However, not all will be deleted - 
such points typically reside near continental boundaries. This happens if the 
emerged ridge points do not spread far enough to &#34;phase out&#34; these points at 
collision regions - likely due to insufficient reconstruction detail. These 
undeleted points form artefacts of anomalously high seafloor age that append 
over the reconstruction time range. 

Once reconstruction by topologies determines the ocean basin snapshot per timestep,
a data frame of all longitudes, latitudes, seafloor ages, spreading rates and any other
attributed z values will be written to a gridding input file per timestep.

Each active longitude, latitude and chosen z value (identified by a gridding input file
column index integer, i.e. `2` is seafloor age) is gridded using nearest-neighbour
interpolation and written to a netCDF4 format.

def create_icosahedral_mesh(refinement_levels):
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Define a global point mesh with Stripy&#39;s
    [icosahedral triangulated mesh](https://github.com/underworldcode/stripy/blob/294354c00dd72e085a018e69c345d9353c6fafef/stripy/spherical_meshes.py#L27)
    and turn all mesh domains into pyGPlates MultiPointOnSphere types.

    This global mesh will be masked with a set of continental or COB terrane
    polygons to define the ocean basin at a given reconstruction time.
    The `refinement_levels` integer is proportional to the resolution of the
    mesh and the ocean/continent boundary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    refinement_levels : int
        Refine the number of points in the triangulation. The larger the 
        refinement level, the sharper the ocean basin resolution.

    Returns
    -------
    multi_point : instance of &lt;pygplates.MultiPointOnSphere&gt;
        The longitues and latitudes that make up the icosahedral ocean mesh
        collated into a MultiPointOnSphere object. 
    icosahedral_global_mesh : instance of &lt;stripy.spherical_meshes.icosahedral_mesh&gt;
        The original global icosahedral triangulated mesh. 
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    import stripy

    # Create the ocean basin mesh using Stripy&#39;s icosahedral spherical mesh
    icosahedral_global_mesh = stripy.spherical_meshes.icosahedral_mesh(
        refinement_levels, 
        include_face_points=False, 
        trisection=False, 
        tree=False
    )
    # Get lons and lats of mesh, and turn them into a MultiPointOnSphere
    lats_arr = np.rad2deg(icosahedral_global_mesh.lats)
    lons_arr = np.rad2deg(icosahedral_global_mesh.lons)
    multi_point = pygplates.MultiPointOnSphere(zip(lats_arr,lons_arr))

    return multi_point, icosahedral_global_mesh


def ensure_polygon_geometry(reconstructed_polygons, rotation_model, time):
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Ensure COB terrane/continental polygon geometries are polygons 
    with reconstruction plate IDs and valid times.

    Notes
    -----
    This step must be done so that the initial set of ocean basin points 
    (the Stripy icosahedral mesh) can be partitioned into plates using
    each reconstruction plate ID for the given plate `model`. 

    This allows for an oceanic point-in-continental 
    polygon query for every identified plate ID. See documentation for
    `point_in_polygon_routine` for more details.

    `ensure_polygon_geometry` works as follows:
    COB terrane/continental polygons are assumed to have been reconstructed 
    already in `reconstructed_polygons` (a list of 
    type &lt;pygplates.ReconstructedFeatureGeometry&gt;). The list contents are 
    turned into a &lt;pygplates.FeatureCollection&gt; to be ascribed a 
    `PolygonOnSphere` geometry, a reconstruction plate ID, and a valid time. 
    Once finished, this feature collection is turned back into a list of 
    instance &lt;pygplates.ReconstructedFeatureGeometry&gt; and returned. 

    This revert must be completed for compatibility with the subsequent 
    point-in-polygon routine. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    reconstructed_polygons : list of instance &lt;pygplates.ReconstructedFeatureGeometry&gt;
        If used in `SeafloorGrid`, these are automatically obtained from the 
        `PlotTopologies.continents` attribute (the reconstructed continental 
        polygons at the current reconstruction time).

    rotation_model : instance of &lt;pygplates.RotationModel&gt;
        A parameter for turning the &lt;pygplates.FeatureCollection&gt; back into a
        list of instance &lt;pygplates.ReconstructedFeatureGeometry&gt; for 
        compatibility with the point-in-polygon routine. 

    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    continent_FeatCol = []
    # self._PlotTopologies_object.continents
    for n in reconstructed_polygons:
        continent_FeatCol.append(n.get_feature())

    polygon_feats = pygplates.FeatureCollection(continent_FeatCol)

    # From GPRM&#39;s force_polygon_geometries(); set feature attributes
    # like valid times and plate IDs to each masking polygon
    polygons = []
    for feature in polygon_feats: 
        for geom in feature.get_all_geometries():
            polygon = pygplates.Feature(
                feature.get_feature_type()
            )
            polygon.set_geometry(
                pygplates.PolygonOnSphere(geom)
            )
            polygon.set_reconstruction_plate_id(
                feature.get_reconstruction_plate_id()
            )

            if feature.get_valid_time()[0]&gt;=feature.get_valid_time()[1]:
                polygon.set_valid_time(
                    feature.get_valid_time()[0],feature.get_valid_time()[1]
                )

    )
    return reconstructed_cobter_polygons


def point_in_polygon_routine(multi_point, COB_polygons):
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Perform Plate Tectonic Tools&#39; point in polygon routine to partition
    points in a `multi_point` MultiPointOnSphere feature based on whether
    they are inside or outside the polygons in `COB_polygons`.

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming the `COB_polygons` have passed through `ensure_polygon_geometry`,
    each polygon should have a plate ID assigned to it.

    This PIP routine serves two purposes for `SeafloorGrid`:

    1) It identifies continental regions in the icosahedral global mesh 
    MultiPointOnSphere feature and &#39;erases&#39; in-continent oceanic points
    for the construction of a continental mask at each timestep;

    2) It identifies oceanic points in the icosahedral global mesh. 
    These points will be passed to a function that calculates each point&#39;s
    proximity to its nearest MOR segment (if any) within the polygonal domain 
    of its allocated plate ID. Each distance is divided by half the 
    `initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate` (an attribute of `SeafloorGrids`) to 
    determine a simplified seafloor age for each point. 

    Number 2) only happens once at the start of the gridding process to 
    momentarily fill the gridding region with initial ocean points that have
    set ages (albeit not from a plate model file). After multiple time steps 
    of reconstruction, the ocean basin will be filled with new points (with 
    plate-model prescribed ages) that emerge from ridge topologies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    PlateReconstruction_object : instance of &lt;gplately.PlateReconstruction&gt;
        A GPlately PlateReconstruction object with a &lt;pygplates.RotationModel&gt; and
        a &lt;pygplates.FeatureCollection&gt; containing topology features. 
    PlotTopologies_object : instance of &lt;gplately.PlotTopologies&gt;
        A GPlately PlotTopologies object with a continental polygon or COB terrane
        polygon file to mask grids with.
    max_time : float
        The maximum time for age gridding.
    min_time : float
        The minimum time for age gridding.
    ridge_time_step : float
        The delta time for resolving ridges (and thus age gridding).
    save_directory : str, default None&#39;
        The top-level directory to save all outputs to.
    file_collection : str, default None
        A string to identify the plate model used (will be automated later).
    refinement_levels : int, default 5
        Control the number of points in the icosahedral mesh (higher integer
        means higher resolution of continent masks).
    ridge_sampling : float, default 0.5
        Spatial resolution (in degrees) at which points that emerge from ridges are tessellated.
    extent : list of float or int, default [-180.,180.,-90.,90.]
        A list containing the mininum longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude and 
        maximum latitude extents for all masking and final grids.
    grid_spacing : float, default None
        The degree spacing/interval with which to space grid points across all masking and
        final grids. If `grid_spacing` is provided, all grids will use it. If not,
        `grid_spacing` defaults to 0.1.
    subduction_collision_parameters : len-2 tuple of float, default (5.0, 10.0)
        A 2-tuple of (threshold velocity delta in kms/my, threshold distance to boundary 
        per My in kms/my)
    initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate : float, default 75.
        A spreading rate to uniformly allocate to points that define the initial ocean 
        basin. These points will have inaccurate ages, but most of them will be phased
        out after points with plate-model prescribed ages emerge from ridges and spread 
        to push them towards collision boundaries (where they are deleted).
    resume_from_checkpoints : bool, default False
        If set to `True`, and the gridding preparation stage (continental masking and/or 
        ridge seed building) is interrupted, SeafloorGrids will resume gridding preparation
        from the last successful preparation time.
        If set to `False`, SeafloorGrids will automatically overwrite all files in 
        `save_directory` if re-run after interruption, or normally re-run, thus beginning
        gridding preparation from scratch. `False` will be useful if data allocated to the
        MOR seed points need to be augmented.
    zval_names : list of str
        A list containing string labels for the z values to attribute to points.
        Will be used as column headers for z value point dataframes.

        * outside the polygons (for the ocean basin point domain)
        * inside the polygons (for the continental mask)

        Points from the mesh outside the continental polygons make up the ocean basin seed

        the filename: &#34;ocean_basin_seed_points_{}Ma.gpmlz&#34; if a `save_directory` is passed.
        Otherwise, the mesh is returned as a pyGPlates FeatureCollection object.

        Notes
        ----- 
        This point mesh represents ocean basin seafloor that was produced
        before `SeafloorGrid.max_time`, and thus has unknown properties like valid
        time and spreading rate. As time passes, the plate reconstruction model sees 
        points emerging from MORs. These new points spread to occupy the ocean basins, 
        moving the initial filler points closer to subduction zones and continental 
        polygons with which they can collide. If a collision is detected by 
        `PlateReconstruction`s `ReconstructByTopologies` object, these points are deleted. 

        Ideally, if a reconstruction tree spans a large time range, **all** initial mesh 
        points would collide with a continent or be subducted, leaving behind a mesh of 
        well-defined MOR-emerged ocean basin points that data can be attributed to. 
        However, some of these initial points situated close to contiental boundaries are 
        retained through time - these form point artefacts with anomalously high ages. Even 
        deep-time plate models (e.g. 1 Ga) will have these artefacts - removing them would 
        require more detail to be added to the reconstruction model.

        into points that make up their shared sub-segments. Rotate these points to the left
        and right of the ridge using their stage rotation so that they spread from the ridge.

        Z-value allocation to each point is done here. In future, a function (like
        the spreading rate function) to calculate general z-data will be an input parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        If MOR seed point building is interrupted, progress is safeguarded as long as 
        `resume_from_checkpoints` is set to `True`.

        This assumes that points spread from ridges symmetrically, with the exception of 
        large ridge jumps at successive timesteps. Therefore, z-values allocated to ridge-emerging
        points will appear symmetrical until changes in spreading ridge geometries create 
        asymmetries.

        In future, this will have a checkpoint save feature so that execution
        (which occurs during preparation for ReconstructByTopologies and can take several hours) 
        can be safeguarded against run interruptions. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The time at which to resolve ridge points and stage-rotate them off the ridge.

        Returns
        -------
        mor_point_features : FeatureCollection
            All ridge seed points that have emerged from all ridge topologies at `time`. 
            These points have spread by being slightly rotated away from
            ridge locations at `time`.

<pre><code class="python">class SeafloorGrid(object):

    &#34;&#34;&#34;A class to generate grids that track data atop global ocean basin points 
    (which emerge from mid ocean ridges) through geological time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    PlateReconstruction_object : instance of &lt;gplately.PlateReconstruction&gt;
        A GPlately PlateReconstruction object with a &lt;pygplates.RotationModel&gt; and
        a &lt;pygplates.FeatureCollection&gt; containing topology features. 
    PlotTopologies_object : instance of &lt;gplately.PlotTopologies&gt;
        A GPlately PlotTopologies object with a continental polygon or COB terrane
        polygon file to mask grids with.
    max_time : float
        The maximum time for age gridding.
    min_time : float
        The minimum time for age gridding.
    ridge_time_step : float
        The delta time for resolving ridges (and thus age gridding).
    save_directory : str, default None&#39;
        The top-level directory to save all outputs to.
    file_collection : str, default None
        A string to identify the plate model used (will be automated later).
    refinement_levels : int, default 5
        Control the number of points in the icosahedral mesh (higher integer
        means higher resolution of continent masks).
    ridge_sampling : float, default 0.5
        Spatial resolution (in degrees) at which points that emerge from ridges are tessellated.
    extent : list of float or int, default [-180.,180.,-90.,90.]
        A list containing the mininum longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude and 
        maximum latitude extents for all masking and final grids.
    grid_spacing : float, default None
        The degree spacing/interval with which to space grid points across all masking and
        final grids. If `grid_spacing` is provided, all grids will use it. If not,
        `grid_spacing` defaults to 0.1.
    subduction_collision_parameters : len-2 tuple of float, default (5.0, 10.0)
        A 2-tuple of (threshold velocity delta in kms/my, threshold distance to boundary 
        per My in kms/my)
    initial_ocean_mean_spreading_rate : float, default 75.
        A spreading rate to uniformly allocate to points that define the initial ocean 
        basin. These points will have inaccurate ages, but most of them will be phased
        out after points with plate-model prescribed ages emerge from ridges and spread 
        to push them towards collision boundaries (where they are deleted).
    resume_from_checkpoints : bool, default False
        If set to `True`, and the gridding preparation stage (continental masking and/or 
        ridge seed building) is interrupted, SeafloorGrids will resume gridding preparation
        from the last successful preparation time.
        If set to `False`, SeafloorGrids will automatically overwrite all files in 
        `save_directory` if re-run after interruption, or normally re-run, thus beginning
        gridding preparation from scratch. `False` will be useful if data allocated to the
        MOR seed points need to be augmented.
    zval_names : list of str
        A list containing string labels for the z values to attribute to points.
        Will be used as column headers for z value point dataframes.

        The ocean mesh starts off as a global-spanning Stripy icosahedral mesh. 
        `create_initial_ocean_seed_points` passes the automatically-resolved-to-current-time
        continental polygons from the `PlotTopologies_object`&#39;s `continents` attribute 
        (which can be from a COB terrane file or a continental polygon file) into 
        Plate Tectonic Tools&#39; point-in-polygon routine. It identifies ocean basin points 
        that lie:
        * outside the polygons (for the ocean basin point domain)
        * inside the polygons (for the continental mask)

        Points from the mesh outside the continental polygons make up the ocean basin seed 
        point mesh. The masked mesh is outputted as a compressed GPML (GPMLZ) file with 
        the filename: &#34;ocean_basin_seed_points_{}Ma.gpmlz&#34; if a `save_directory` is passed.
        Otherwise, the mesh is returned as a pyGPlates FeatureCollection object.

        Notes
        ----- 
        This point mesh represents ocean basin seafloor that was produced
        before `SeafloorGrid.max_time`, and thus has unknown properties like valid
        time and spreading rate. As time passes, the plate reconstruction model sees 
        points emerging from MORs. These new points spread to occupy the ocean basins, 
        moving the initial filler points closer to subduction zones and continental 
        polygons with which they can collide. If a collision is detected by 
        `PlateReconstruction`s `ReconstructByTopologies` object, these points are deleted. 

        Ideally, if a reconstruction tree spans a large time range, **all** initial mesh 
        points would collide with a continent or be subducted, leaving behind a mesh of 
        well-defined MOR-emerged ocean basin points that data can be attributed to. 
        However, some of these initial points situated close to contiental boundaries are 
        retained through time - these form point artefacts with anomalously high ages. Even 
        deep-time plate models (e.g. 1 Ga) will have these artefacts - removing them would 
        require more detail to be added to the reconstruction model.

        into points that make up their shared sub-segments. Rotate these points to the left
        and right of the ridge using their stage rotation so that they spread from the ridge.

        Z-value allocation to each point is done here. In future, a function (like
        the spreading rate function) to calculate general z-data will be an input parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        If MOR seed point building is interrupted, progress is safeguarded as long as 
        `resume_from_checkpoints` is set to `True`.

        This assumes that points spread from ridges symmetrically, with the exception of 
        large ridge jumps at successive timesteps. Therefore, z-values allocated to ridge-emerging
        points will appear symmetrical until changes in spreading ridge geometries create 
        asymmetries.

        In future, this will have a checkpoint save feature so that execution
        (which occurs during preparation for ReconstructByTopologies and can take several hours) 
        can be safeguarded against run interruptions. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : float
            The time at which to resolve ridge points and stage-rotate them off the ridge.

        Returns
        -------
        mor_point_features : FeatureCollection
            All ridge seed points that have emerged from all ridge topologies at `time`. 
            These points have spread by being slightly rotated away from
            ridge locations at `time`.

    -----
    If MOR seed point building is interrupted, progress is safeguarded as long as 
    `resume_from_checkpoints` is set to `True`.

    This assumes that points spread from ridges symmetrically, with the exception of 
    large ridge jumps at successive timesteps. Therefore, z-values allocated to ridge-emerging
    points will appear symmetrical until changes in spreading ridge geometries create 
    asymmetries.

    In future, this will have a checkpoint save feature so that execution
    (which occurs during preparation for ReconstructByTopologies and can take several hours)

    ----------
    time : float
        The time at which to resolve ridge points and stage-rotate them off the ridge.

    Returns
    -------
    mor_point_features : FeatureCollection
        All ridge seed points that have emerged from all ridge topologies at `time`. 
        These points have spread by being slightly rotated away from
        ridge locations at `time`.
