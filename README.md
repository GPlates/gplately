GPlately was created to accelerate spatio-temporal data analysis by leveraging [pyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html) and [PlateTectonicTools](https://github.com/EarthByte/PlateTectonicTools) within a simplified Python interface. This object-oriented package enables the reconstruction of data through deep geologic time (such as points, lines, polygons, and rasters), the interrogation of plate kinematic information (plate velocities, rates of subduction and seafloor spreading), the rapid comparison of multiple plate motion models, and the plotting of reconstructed output data on maps. All tools are designed to be parallel-safe, accelerating spatio-temporal analysis over multiple CPU processors.

GPlately requires a working installation of pyGPlates, which is freely
available at https://www.gplates.org/download.
All major system architectures (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows) are supported, and installation instructions
are [well documented](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/pygplates_getting_started.html#installation).
Sample data is also available from [EarthByte servers](https://www.earthbyte.org/category/resources/), which
include rasters, seafloor age grids, rotation files, and more to help you get started with plate reconstructions.

## Installation

### 1. Using conda (recommended)

You can install the latest stable public release of `GPlately` and all its dependencies using conda.
This is the preferred method for installing `GPlately`, as it downloads binaries from the "conda-forge" channel.

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge gplately
```

#### Creating a new conda environment

We recommend creating a new conda environment in which to install `GPlately`. This avoids any potential conflicts within your base Python environment. In the example below, we create a new environment called `my-env`.

```sh
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
conda install -c conda-forge gplately
```

The `my-env` environment needs to be activated before using `GPlately`, i.e., `conda activate my-env`.

### 2. Using pip

Alternatively, you can install the latest stable public release of `GPlately` using the pip package manager.

```sh
pip install gplately
```

or from this GitHub repository:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GPlates/gplately.git
```

#### Pull from repository

**First-time installation:** To install the latest version of GPlately from a specific repository branch (e.g., `master`), run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
cd /directory-to-keep-gplately-files # go into the directory in which you'd like to keep the GPlately repository
git clone https://github.com/GPlates/gplately.git gplately.git
cd gplately.git # go into the root directory of your cloned gplately repository
git checkout master # check out the "master" branch or the name of branch you want
git pull # fetch all recent code changes from the GitHub remote repository to your computer
pip install . # alternatively, you can use "pip install -e ." to install gplately in editable mode
```

**Update installation:** To update your installation of GPlately by fetching the latest code from a specific repository branch (e.g., `master`), run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
cd /path-to-gplately-repository # go into the root directory of your cloned gplately repository, such as ./gplately.git
git checkout master # check out the "master" branch or the name of branch you want
git pull # fetch all recent code changes from the GitHub remote repository to your computer
pip install . # alternatively, you can use "pip install -e ." to install gplately in editable mode
```

### 3. Using Docker üê≥

üëâ Run GPlately example notebooks with Docker

- `docker pull gplates/gplately`
