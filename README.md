GPlately was created to accelerate spatio-temporal data analysis leveraging [pyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html) and [PlateTectonicTools](https://github.com/EarthByte/PlateTectonicTools) within a simplified Python interface. This object-oriented package enables the reconstruction of data through deep geologic time (points, lines, polygons, and rasters), the interrogation of plate kinematic information (plate velocities, rates of subduction and seafloor spreading), the rapid comparison between multiple plate motion models, and the plotting of reconstructed output data on maps. All tools are designed to be parallel-safe to accelerate spatio-temporal analysis over multiple CPU processors.

![SeedPointGIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/muller19_seedpoints.gif)

GPlately requires a working installation of pyGPlates, which is freely
available at https://www.gplates.org/download.
All major system architectures (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) are supported and installation instructions
are [well documented](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/pygplates_getting_started.html#installation).
Sample data is also available from [EarthByte servers](https://www.earthbyte.org/category/resources/), which
includes rasters, seafloor age grids, rotation files, and more to get started with plate reconstructions.

## Installation

### 1. Using conda (recommended)

You can install the latest stable public release of `GPlately` and all of its dependencies using conda.
This is the preferred method to install `GPlately` which downloads binaries from the conda-forge channel.

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge gplately
```

#### Creating a new conda environment

We recommend creating a new conda environment inside which to install `GPlately`. This avoids any potential conflicts in your base Python environment. In the example below we create a new environment called "`my-env`":

```sh
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
conda install -c conda-forge gplately
```

`my-env` needs to be activated whenever you use `GPlately`: i.e. `conda activate my-env`.

### 2. Using pip

Alternatively, you can install the latest stable public release of `GPlately` using the pip package manager.

```sh
pip install gplately
```

or from this GitHub repository:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GPlates/gplately.git
```

#### Pull from repository

**First-time installation:** To install the latest version of GPlately from a specific repository branch (e.g. `master`), copy the following commands into your terminal:

```sh
cd /path/to/desired/directory #Change your command directory to where you'd like to clone GPlately
git clone https://github.com/GPlates/gplately.git
cd gplately # navigate within the gplately folder
git checkout master # or the name of whichever branch you need
git pull # fetch all recent changes from this branch
pip install .
```

**Update installation from cloned repo:** To update your installation of GPlately by fetching the latest pushes from a specific repository branch (e.g. `master`), copy the following commands into your terminal:

```sh
cd /path/to/gplately/directory #Should be where gplately is cloned - must end in /.../gplately
git checkout master # or the name of whichever branch you need
git pull # fetch all recent changes from this branch
pip install .
```

### 3. Using Docker üê≥

üëâ Run GPlately example notebooks

- `docker pull gplates/gplately`

## Usage

- [`DataServer`](#the-dataserver-object) - download rotation files and topology features from plate models on EarthByte's webDAV server
- [`PlateModelManager`](#the-platemodelmanager-object) - download and manage the plate reconstruction model files
- [`PlateReconstruction`](#the-platereconstruction-object) - reconstruct features, tesselate mid ocean ridges, subduction zones
- [`Points`](#the-points-object) - partition points onto plates, rotate back through time
- [`Raster`](#the-raster-object) - read in NetCDF grids, interpolation, resampling
- [`PlotTopologies`](#the-plottopologies-object) - one stop shop for plotting ridges, trenches, subduction teeth

### The `PlateModelManager` class

The **PlateModelManager** class was introduced as a more efficient alternative to the **DataServer** class, 
designed specifically for downloading and managing plate reconstruction model files.

A complete example of using the PlateModelManager class is available at https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/Examples/introducing-plate-model-manager.py .

```python
from plate_model_manager import PlateModelManager, PresentDayRasterManager
from gplately import PlateReconstruction, PlotTopologies, Raster

model = PlateModelManager().get_model(
    "Muller2019", # model name
    data_dir="plate-model-repo" # the local folder where you would like to save the model files
    )

recon_model = PlateReconstruction(
    model.get_rotation_model(),
    topology_features=model.get_layer("Topologies"),
    static_polygons=model.get_layer("StaticPolygons"),
)
gplot = PlotTopologies(
    recon_model,
    coastlines=model.get_layer("Coastlines"),
    COBs=model.get_layer("COBs"),
    time=55,
)
# get present-day topography raster
raster = Raster(PresentDayRasterManager().get_raster("topography"))
# get paleo-agegrid raster at 100Ma from Muller2019 model
agegrid = Raster(model.get_raster("AgeGrids", time=100))   
```

### The `DataServer` class

The **DataServer** class can be used to download:

- rotation models
- topology features
- static polygons
- coastlines
- continents
- continent-ocean boundaries
- age grids and rasters
- geological feature data

from assorted plate reconstruction models. These files are needed to construct most of `GPlately`'s objects. For example,
we can download a `rotation model`, a set of `topology features` and some `static polygons` from the [M√ºller et al. 2019](https://www.earthbyte.org/muller-et-al-2019-deforming-plate-reconstruction-and-seafloor-age-grids-tectonics/)
global Mesozoic‚ÄìCenozoic deforming plate motion model. (Use the newer **PlateModelManager** class when it is possible.)

```python
import gplately 

gdownload = gplately.download.DataServer("Muller2019")

# Download plate reconstruction files and geometries from the M√ºller et al. 2019 model
rotation_model, topology_features, static_polygons = gdownload.get_plate_reconstruction_files()
coastlines, continents, COBs = gdownload.get_topology_geometries()

# Download the M√ºller et al. 2019 100 Ma age grid
age_grid = gdownload.get_age_grid(times=100)

# Download the ETOPO1 geotiff raster
etopo = gdownload.get_raster("ETOPO1_tif")
```

### The `PlateReconstruction` class

The **PlateReconstruction** class contains tools to reconstruct geological features like tectonic plates and plate boundaries, and to interrogate plate kinematic data like plate motion velocities, and rates of subduction and seafloor spreading.

A complete Jupyter notebook example is available at https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/02-PlateReconstructions.ipynb .

```python
from plate_model_manager import PlateModelManager
from gplately import PlateReconstruction

model =  PlateModelManager().get_model("Muller2019")

# Build a plate reconstruction model using a rotation model, a set of topology features and static polygons
recon_model = PlateReconstruction(
    model.get_rotation_model(),
    topology_features=model.get_layer("Topologies"),
    static_polygons=model.get_layer("StaticPolygons"),
)
```

### The `Points` class

The methods in the **Points** class track the motion of a point (or group of points) represented by a latitude and longitude through geologic time. This motion can be visualised using flowlines or motion paths and quantified with point motion velocities.

A complete Jupyter notebook example is available at https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/03-WorkingWithPoints.ipynb .

```python
import numpy as np
import gplately
from plate_model_manager import PlateModelManager

model =  PlateModelManager().get_model("Muller2019")

# Create a plate reconstruction model using a rotation model, a set of topology features and static polygons
recon_model = gplately.auxiliary.get_plate_reconstruction(model)

# Define some points using their latitude and longitude coordinates so we can track them though time!
pt_lons = np.array([140., 150., 160.])
pt_lats = np.array([-30., -40., -50.])

# Create a Points instance from these points
gpts = gplately.Points(recon_model, pt_lons, pt_lats)
```

![PointData](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/surface_hotspot_plumes.png)

### The `Raster` class

The **Raster** class contains methods to work with netCDF4 or MaskedArray gridded data. Grids may be filled, resized, resampled, and reconstructed back and forwards through geologic time. Other array data can also be interpolated onto Raster grids.

A complete Jupyter notebook example is available at https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/06-Rasters.ipynb .

```python
import gplately
from plate_model_manager import PlateModelManager, PresentDayRasterManager

model =  PlateModelManager().get_model("Muller2019")

# Create a plate reconstruction model using a rotation model, a set of topology features and static polygons
recon_model = gplately.auxiliary.get_plate_reconstruction(model)

# Any numpy array can be turned into a Raster object!
raster = gplately.Raster(
    plate_reconstruction=recon_model,
    data=PresentDayRasterManager().get_raster("topography"),
    extent="global",  # equivalent to (-180, 180, -90, 90)
    origin="lower",  # or set extent to (-180, 180, -90, 90)
)

# Reconstruct the raster data to 50 million years ago! 
reconstructed_raster = raster.reconstruct(
    time=50, 
    partitioning_features=model.get_layer("ContinentalPolygons")
    )
```

Below is a plot of the [ETOPO1 global relief raster](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) at present day, and reconstructed to 50Ma:

![RasterImg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPlates/gplately/master/Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/etopo_reconstruction.png)

### The `PlotTopologies` class

The PlotTopologies class works with the aforementioned PlateReconstruction class to plot geologic features of different types listed here, as well as coastline, continent and continent-ocean boundary geometries reconstructed through time using pyGPlates.

A complete Jupyter notebook example is available at https://github.com/GPlates/gplately/blob/master/Notebooks/02-PlateReconstructions.ipynb .

```python
import gplately
from plate_model_manager import PlateModelManager
from gplately import PlotTopologies

model =  PlateModelManager().get_model("Muller2019")
recon_model = gplately.auxiliary.get_plate_reconstruction(model)

gplot = PlotTopologies(
        recon_model,
        coastlines=model.get_layer("Coastlines"),
        COBs=model.get_layer("COBs"),
        continents= model.get_layer("ContinentalPolygons"),
        time=55)
```

Below are some continents, coastlines, COBs, ridges and transforms, trenches, subduction teeth and
seafloor age grids plotted using `PlotTopologies`!
